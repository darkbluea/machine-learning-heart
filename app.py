            With the still growing amount of victims from the covid-19's vaccine,
	    more and more people are suffering from its side effect. Like any vaccine, 
	    COVID-19 vaccines can cause mild, short term side effects, such as a 
	    low-grade fever or pain or redness at the injection site. Most reactions 
	    to vaccines are mild and go away within a few days on their own. More 
	    serious or long-lasting side effects to vaccines are also possible. 
	    One of the more serious and long-lasting side effect is the myocarditis, 
	    a type of heart disease which affects thousands after the vaccination. 
	    However it is not the only heart disease possible side effect from the vaccination. 
	    Therefore we deployed an AI able to identify and/or predict if someone might or 
	    might not have a heart disease.

        Simply fill in all the parameters

	can just invent values for each
